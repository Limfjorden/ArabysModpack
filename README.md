# ArabysModpack
A rimworld modpack with a desert theme.

# What is in this repository:
- Arabys Xenotype Name Changer: A small mod I made to change the names of some of the vanilla xenotypes.
- ArabysWorldPreset.rws: A preset with factions for world presets. Only the factions are done as of yet, but I plan to make a custom planet for the modpack.
- Configs: This folder contains all the configs you need to get the Arabys experience, divided among the essential and the other mods.
